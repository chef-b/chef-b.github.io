## I Built My First Portfolio in 2 Days (With Zero Experience)

I’ve never properly coded before.

No CS degree, no bootcamp - all I did was a one-day SheCodes workshop and I kinda liked it.

With a background in Marketing and Socio-legal studies, I wanted to apply for jobs but they all asked for portfolio work.

So I thought: let’s see what I can do.

## Day 1: Who Is Ruby?

I chose Jekyll because it was quite popular (battle-tested) and seemed beginner-friendly (me). I already planned for Git Pages to host because free = good.

Immediately I learned:
- Ruby exists.
- Code extensions are called "gems" (Steven Universe-core).
- A Gemfile is a storage list of instructions.
- Bundler installs those instructions.

Did I fully understand Ruby? No.
Did I panic slightly? Yes.

I have always been a bit of a perfectionist but I've been intentional in learning the art of letting go and I'd set myself a 2 day 'MVP' challenge. 

I really just hoped the pieces would fall into place.

## Static vs Dynamic ("Wait..Static Can Still Update?”)

I went down a rabbit hole trying to understand the difference. 

Static site:
- Pre-built HTML
- Fast
- Secure
- No database

Dynamic site:
- Logins?
- Databases?
- Much more complexity...

I was fighting old habits with the analysis paralysis but I was determined to get this portfolio done in the time limit. I conceded: static was enough for now.

I needed a portfolio.

## Inheriting Vim: there's no i in team

As a total beginner and with a tight deadline, I couldn't have done it without the team.

The unsung heroes: Chatgpt, Claud.ai, the guy that made beautiful jekyll and the many people who got roasted in public forums for asking the same questions I had. Also, my housemate Frank for being my IT master.

On my first day, I got stuck editing. Frank came in clutch and argued vim was the superior choice, graciously installed vim and left me to my own devices.

But I had forgotten that he almost got me started with Arch Linux and what seemed beginner-friendly to him, wasn't always the case for me. 

I was trying to edit files in the terminal using Vim.

I forgot to press `i`.

Nothing was typing.

I thought my laptop broke.

It did not.
I was simply not in insert mode.

This was humbling.

## What I Actually Built

- A portfolio site using Jekyll
- Hosted on GitHub Pages
- Custom retro theme written in CSS
- Responsive design
- Tagging and blog indexing
- Search functionality
- Deployed via Git

I used:
- ChatGPT
- Claude
- Google
- My cybersecurity housemate

Which, I’ve since learned, is basically how software development works nowadays.

## What I Learned

1. You don’t need to know everything to start, just the *La Pasion*.
2. Documentation looks terrifying and sometimes is. 
3. Deployment is just a series of small steps.
4. CSS is cooked. 
5. [Paint](https://paint.js.org/) still exits.
6. I actually enjoyed this dumpsterfire and solving technical problems.

## The Biggest Realisation

I didn’t just copy and paste code. I cooked it... badly until enough times I got a little bit better. 

I:
- Debugged Git errors.
- Overrode theme CSS.
- Fixed icon color conflicts. (it was Bootstrap all along!!)
- Structured content.
- Deployed changes.

And when things broke, I didn’t quit. I tried to fix it. I had a vision for this and I was committed.

I leaned into my curiosity and gave it a real go.

## What’s Next?

This project isn’t perfect.

But it’s here.
It’s mine.
And it's not Squarespace.

Now I have a place to share my projects. Best believe I have a few in mind.
