i'm Bee and this is my swamp. 

we're here because life happened and i ended up burning out. after years, i came face to face with how trying to keep up with my own expectations was eating me alive and on doctor's orders, i took my first ever break. 

it was time to rebuild my life and get honest with myself about where some of this started and i thought i had to get serious. ironically, my year of getting serious has felt the most unserious but i reckon that's exactly what i needed. 

so i'm facing my fears and following up on some of that inner kid stuff.

self reflection and whatot, one of my earliest regrets was Minecraft in primary school. 

i remember the first time i wanted to download my first minecraft mod but that we had one computer in the family and i was absolutely terrified to break it.

paralysed with fear, the [Mo' Creatures](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1272337-mo-creatures-v12-0-0-for-minecraft-1-12-1-now) mod stayed in the download folder. it never saw the light of day and that memory represents a curiosity in technology that i didn't get to explore.

until now! 

with my own laptop and a linux usb at the ready if i do mess this up.

here's to making and breaking things... publicly.
